Abstract

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a common method used to monitor the electric activity of the brain and diagnose brain abnormalities such as epilepsy. Compared to other methods of brain activity analysis such as fMRI, EEGs are more accessible and widely used. EEGs contain extremely large amounts of data and noise that make the manual diagnosis of seizures and epilepsy a challenge. As with all neurodegenerative diseases, epilepsy can be treated much more effectively if diagnosed in a timely manner. Hence, a reliable machine learning approach to EEG signal analysis would prove to be a significant advancement in signal processing. The objective of this project is to create a dependable framework for EEG signal analysis that can report neurological abnormalities using simply a raw EEG signal. This framework would then be exported to the cloud via a predictive web service, allowing for simple and accessible EEG analysis. The first step in creating such a model is to preprocess raw EEG signal analysis and extract prominent features from the data using methods such as Discrete Wavelet Transform. The coeffecients and other significant data features obtained from the wavelet transform will then be used to train a Probablistic Neural Network Classifier. The completed framework will 1. Pre-Process Data 2. Output a description of abnormalities
